## üìò Notes

### **Deep Dive: AWS Snow Family & Storage Gateway**

Moving data is a core challenge in cloud computing. For massive datasets, network transfers can be too slow, costly, or unreliable. AWS Snow Family provides physical devices for offline data transfer and edge computing. Separately, AWS Storage Gateway provides a hybrid bridge to seamlessly connect your on-premises applications to AWS storage.

---

### **1. AWS Snow Family ‚ùÑÔ∏è**

The AWS Snow Family is a collection of physical devices that help you migrate petabyte-scale data into and out of AWS. They are essentially secure, ruggedized, shippable storage and compute devices.

- **AWS Snowcone:**
    - **What it is:** The smallest member of the family. A small, portable, and rugged device.
    - **Capacity:** Two models: 8 TB HDD or 14 TB HDD. Also has 2 vCPUs and 4 GB of memory.
    - **Use Case:** Designed for small-scale data transfer, edge computing, and use in disconnected or mobile environments like vehicles or industrial settings. It can be battery-operated. It supports AWS DataSync for online transfer.
- **AWS Snowball Edge:**
    - **What it is:** A petabyte-scale data transfer device with onboard storage and compute capabilities.
    - **Device Types:**
        1. **Snowball Edge Storage Optimized:** Best for large-scale data migrations. Provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage. It also has 40 vCPUs and 80 GB of memory for light edge computing.
        2. **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized:** Designed for running more demanding edge compute workloads. It has more compute power (up to 104 vCPUs) and optional GPUs, but less storage capacity.
    - **Use Case:** Large data migrations (e.g., from data centers), machine learning at the edge, and running EC2 instances or Lambda functions in disconnected environments like a factory floor or a ship.
- **AWS Snowmobile:**
    - **What it is:** An exabyte-scale data transfer service. It is literally a **45-foot long shipping container** pulled by a semi-trailer truck.
    - **Capacity:** Up to 100 PB (Petabytes).
    - **Use Case:** For migrating extremely large datasets, such as entire data centers, video libraries, or scientific data repositories. AWS drives the truck to your data center, helps you connect it, and then drives it back to an AWS facility to import the data.

**The Snow Family Process:**

1. You request a device from the AWS Console.
2. AWS ships the secure, encrypted device to you.
3. You connect the device to your local network and use the AWS OpsHub software or a DataSync agent to transfer data onto it.
4. You ship the device back to AWS.
5. AWS imports the data from the device into your specified S3 bucket.

### **2. AWS Storage Gateway** üåâ

AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that provides a bridge between your on-premises environment and AWS Storage. It's deployed as a virtual machine appliance in your data center.

- **Gateway Types:**
    1. **File Gateway:**
        - **What it provides:** A file interface (**NFS** or **SMB**) on-premises.
        - **How it works:** Your on-premises applications write files to the gateway's file share. The gateway then converts these files into objects and stores them durably in **Amazon S3**. It maintains a local cache of recently accessed files for low-latency performance.
        - **Use Case:** Easily extend on-premises file storage to S3, back up on-premises file data to the cloud, and provide cloud access to on-premises data.
    2. **Volume Gateway:**
        - **What it provides:** Block storage (**iSCSI**) to on-premises applications.
        - **Modes:**
            - **Cached Volumes:** The primary data is stored in S3, and a cache of frequently accessed data is kept locally on the gateway. This minimizes the need for on-premises storage.
            - **Stored Volumes:** The entire dataset is stored on-premises for low-latency access, and the gateway asynchronously backs up this data as EBS Snapshots in AWS. This is a disaster recovery solution.
    3. **Tape Gateway:**
        - **What it provides:** A virtual tape library (VTL) using the **iSCSI** interface.
        - **How it works:** It integrates with your existing backup software (like Veeam, NetBackup, etc.). The backup software writes to "virtual tapes," which are stored in S3. You can then archive these virtual tapes to S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive for long-term, low-cost retention.
        - **Use Case:** A modern, cost-effective, and durable replacement for physical tape backup infrastructure.
