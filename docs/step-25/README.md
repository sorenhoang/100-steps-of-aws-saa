## ðŸ“˜ Notes

### **Deep Dive: EBS Volume Types & Performance**

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides a range of volume types that differ in performance characteristics and price. Choosing the right volume type is a critical part of designing a cost-effective and performant architecture. The main choice is between Solid State Drives (SSD), optimized for transactional workloads (measured in IOPS), and Hard Disk Drives (HDD), optimized for streaming workloads (measured in Throughput).

---

### **1. Solid State Drives (SSD-Backed)** ðŸš€

SSD-backed volumes are designed for workloads that involve frequent, small, random read/write operations where the dominant performance metric is **IOPS** (Input/Output Operations Per Second).

- **General Purpose SSD (gp2 / gp3):**
  - **Use Case:** The default, all-around best choice for a wide variety of workloads. Perfect for system boot volumes, virtual desktops, development/test environments, and most applications.
  - **gp2 (Legacy):** Performance is tied to size. It provides a baseline of 3 IOPS per GiB of volume size and can "burst" up to 3,000 IOPS for short periods.
  - **gp3 (Latest & Recommended):** The key advantage is that you can provision **IOPS and throughput independently** of storage size. It provides a consistent baseline of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MiB/s throughput regardless of size, which you can scale up as needed. It's often cheaper and more performant than `gp2`.
- **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 / io2 / io2 Block Express):**
  - **Use Case:** Your most critical, I/O-intensive applications that require sustained, high IOPS performance. Ideal for large relational or NoSQL databases (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, Cassandra).
  - **Performance:** You provision a specific, guaranteed number of IOPS (e.g., 40,000 IOPS).
  - **io2 / io2 Block Express:** The latest generation, offering much higher durability (99.999% - "5 nines") and a better IOPS-to-size ratio than `io1`. `io2 Block Express` is the highest performance block storage on AWS, offering sub-millisecond latency.

---

### **2. Hard Disk Drives (HDD-Backed)** ðŸ’¿

HDD-backed volumes are designed for large, streaming workloads where the dominant performance attribute is **Throughput** (measured in MiB/s). They are not suitable for boot volumes.

- **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1):**
  - **Use Case:** Frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads with large datasets and large I/O sizes. Perfect for big data processing frameworks like Hadoop and Kafka, data warehouses, and log processing.
  - **Performance:** Measured in MiB/s. Performance scales with the size of the volume.
- **Cold HDD (sc1):**
  - **Use Case:** The lowest-cost block storage. Designed for large volumes of infrequently accessed data where cost is the primary driver. Think of it as a "cold" storage tier for block data.
  - **Performance:** Lower throughput than `st1`. Suitable for data you might access only a few times a day.

### **Summary of Volume Types**

| Category | Volume Type                    | Primary Use Case                                                 | Performance Metric         |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **SSD**  | **gp3** (General Purpose)      | **Default for most workloads**, boot volumes, web servers        | Balanced IOPS & Throughput |
| **SSD**  | **io2** (Provisioned IOPS)     | Critical databases, low-latency apps needing **guaranteed IOPS** | **IOPS**                   |
| **HDD**  | **st1** (Throughput Optimized) | Big data, data warehouses, log processing                        | **Throughput (MiB/s)**     |
| **HDD**  | **sc1** (Cold)                 | Infrequently accessed data, lowest-cost block storage            | Throughput (MiB/s)         |

### **AWS SAA-C03 Style Questions & Explanations**

**1. A large transactional database requires sustained performance of at least 20,000 IOPS for its primary data files. Which EBS volume type is specifically designed to meet this requirement?**

- A. General Purpose SSD (gp3)
- B. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
- C. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
- D. Cold HDD (sc1)

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** When a workload demands a specific, sustained, and guaranteed level of IOPS, the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2) family is the only correct choice. It is designed for mission-critical, I/O-intensive databases that cannot tolerate performance fluctuations.

</details>

---

**2. A company is running a big data processing job using a Hadoop cluster on EC2. The workload involves streaming large amounts of data sequentially to and from the disks. The company wants the most cost-effective storage solution for this task. Which EBS volume type is most suitable?**

- A. io2 Block Express
- B. gp3
- C. st1
- D. sc1

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** This workload is throughput-bound (large, sequential streams), not IOPS-bound. The Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) volume type is engineered and priced specifically for this kind of big data workload, offering high throughput at a much lower cost than any of the SSD options.

</details>

---

**3. What is the primary advantage of using the `gp3` volume type over the older `gp2`?**

- A. `gp3` offers higher durability than `gp2`.
- B. `gp3` allows you to provision IOPS and throughput performance independently of the storage size.
- C. `gp3` is an HDD-backed volume, making it cheaper.
- D. `gp3` supports encryption, while `gp2` does not.

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The key innovation of gp3 is the decoupling of performance from size. With gp2, you had to provision a larger disk just to get more IOPS. With gp3, you get a solid baseline performance (3,000 IOPS / 125 MiB/s) and can pay to scale performance up separately, which often results in better performance at a lower cost.

</details>

---

**4. For which of the following workloads would an HDD-backed volume like `st1` or `sc1` be an unsuitable choice?**

- A. A data warehouse.

**7. A database administrator is running a report that performs a large table scan. What is the primary performance metric for this operation?**

- A. IOPS
- B. Throughput (MiB/s)
- C. Durability
- D. Latency

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** A table scan is a large, sequential read operation. This type of workload is measured by Throughput, which is the amount of data that can be transferred per second (MiB/s). IOPS (A) measures performance for small, random read/write operations, like those in a transactional database.

</details>

---

**8. An EC2 instance is configured with a `gp2` volume. The administrator notices that performance is sometimes very fast but at other times becomes very slow. What is the likely cause?**

- A. The volume is running out of burst credits.
- B. The `gp2` volume is not a bootable volume type.
- C. The volume has been detached from the instance.
- D. The instance is in a different Availability Zone from the volume.

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:** gp2 volumes use a burst bucket model for performance. The volume accumulates I/O credits when it is idle or under its baseline performance level. During periods of high I/O, it spends these credits to "burst" to a higher performance level. If the workload is sustained, the burst credits can be exhausted, causing performance to throttle down to the much lower baseline level.

</details>

---

**9. What is the recommended default EBS volume type for most common workloads, such as system boot volumes and web servers?**

- A. io1
- B. st1
- C. gp3
- D. sc1

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** AWS recommends gp3 as the go-to General Purpose volume type for the vast majority of use cases. It provides an excellent balance of price and performance and offers more flexibility than its predecessor, gp2.

</details>

---

**10. You need to modify an existing EBS volume to increase its provisioned IOPS. Can this be done without detaching the volume from the instance?**

- A. No, the instance must be stopped and the volume detached first.
- B. Yes, you can use the EBS Elastic Volumes feature to modify the IOPS of a live volume with no downtime.
- C. No, you must create a new volume with the desired IOPS and migrate the data.
- D. Yes, but only if the volume is an HDD-backed type.

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The EBS Elastic Volumes feature allows you to dynamically modify the size, type, and IOPS (for io1/io2/gp3) of an EBS volume while it is still attached to a running instance. This allows for performance and capacity changes without service interruption.

</details>

---

**11. An application performs many small, random read and write operations per second. Which performance metric is most important for this workload?**

- A. Throughput (MiB/s)
- B. IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
- C. Storage Capacity (GB)
- D. Durability percentage

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Small, random I/O is characteristic of transactional workloads like databases. The key performance metric for this access pattern is IOPS. SSD-backed volumes (gp3, io2) are designed to provide high IOPS.

</details>

---

**12. Why would a company choose `io2` over `gp3` for a database?**

- A. `io2` is significantly cheaper than `gp3`.
- B. The database requires a guaranteed, consistent level of IOPS that exceeds the baseline performance of `gp3`.
- C. `gp3` cannot be used for databases.
- D. `io2` has lower durability than `gp3`.

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** While gp3 is excellent for general use, its performance is not guaranteed in the same way as io2. A company would choose io2 when their application's performance is critically dependent on a consistent, non-variable, and high level of IOPS that gp3 cannot provide.

</details>

---

**13. Which of the following is a characteristic of `st1` volumes?**

- A. They are ideal for small, random I/O workloads.
- B. They cannot be used as a boot volume.
