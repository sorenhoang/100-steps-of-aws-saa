# Step 63: AWS Config, Inspector, GuardDuty

## üéØ Objective

- [x] Master: **AWS Config, Inspector, GuardDuty**

## üìò Notes

### **Deep Dive: Config, Inspector, & GuardDuty**

Think of securing your AWS account like securing a house. AWS Config is the inspector who checks if all your windows and doors are built to code. Amazon Inspector checks if the locks on those doors are easy to pick. Amazon GuardDuty is the intelligent security system that watches for burglars trying to get in.

### **1. AWS Config** üìã

**What it is:** A service that continuously monitors and records your AWS resource **configurations** and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired policies.

- **Core Question:** *"Is my resource configured correctly according to my rules?"*
- **How it works:**
    1. **Recording:** Config discovers and records the current configuration of your supported AWS resources (e.g., an EC2 instance, a security group, an S3 bucket). It also records every change to that configuration over time.
    2. **Evaluation:** You use **Config Rules** to define your desired configuration state. A rule can be a managed rule provided by AWS (e.g., "ebs-encryption-enabled") or a custom rule you create with a Lambda function.
    3. **Compliance:** Config continuously evaluates your resources against your rules and flags them as **COMPLIANT** or **NON_COMPLIANT**.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Configuration History:** Provides a detailed history of all configuration changes for a resource, which is invaluable for troubleshooting and auditing.
    - **Remediation:** Can be configured to automatically remediate non-compliant resources using AWS Systems Manager Automation documents.
- **Use Case:**
    - **Compliance Auditing:** Answering questions like, "Are all of my EBS volumes encrypted?" or "Do any of my security groups allow unrestricted SSH access?"
    - **Change Management:** Tracking all configuration changes in your environment.
    - **Troubleshooting:** Identifying which configuration change caused a recent operational issue.

### **2. Amazon Inspector** üïµÔ∏è

**What it is:** An automated **vulnerability management service** that continuously scans your AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

- **Core Question:** *"Does my EC2 instance or container image have known software vulnerabilities (CVEs) or is it exposed to the network?"*
- **How it works:**
    - Once enabled, Inspector automatically discovers all your running EC2 instances and container images residing in ECR.
    - It continuously scans these resources without needing to install an agent (for EC2, it uses the AWS Systems Manager Agent).
    - It compares the installed software packages against a database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
    - It also analyzes network accessibility to identify any unintended open paths to your instances.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Continuous Scanning:** It's not a one-time scan; it continuously monitors your resources as they are deployed and changed.
    - **Risk Score:** It provides a highly contextualized risk score for each finding, helping you prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities.
- **Use Case:**
    - **Vulnerability Management:** Finding unpatched software with known CVEs (e.g., an outdated version of Nginx or Log4j).
    - **Network Exposure Analysis:** Identifying if an instance with a critical vulnerability is also reachable from the internet.

### **3. Amazon GuardDuty** üëÆ

**What it is:** An intelligent **threat detection service** that continuously monitors your AWS accounts and workloads for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.

- **Core Question:** *"Is someone trying to compromise my AWS account or resources right now?"*
- **How it works:** GuardDuty analyzes multiple AWS data sources without you needing to enable them. These include:
    - **VPC Flow Logs**
    - **DNS Logs**
    - **AWS CloudTrail Events** (Management and Data Events)
- **What it Detects:** It uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify potential threats, such as:
    - An EC2 instance communicating with a known crypto-mining or command-and-control server.
    - Unusual API calls from a strange geographic location.
    - Port scanning or attempts to probe your instances.
    - Potential account compromise, like API calls being made from a TOR node.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Intelligent and Managed:** You enable it with one click, and it starts analyzing data sources without any agents or complex setup.
    - **Actionable Findings:** It generates security findings with severity levels (High, Medium, Low) that are easy to understand. Findings can be sent to EventBridge to trigger automated responses.
