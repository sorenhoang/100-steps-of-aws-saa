## üìò Notes

### **Deep Dive: VPN & Direct Connect Overview**

When you need to connect your corporate data center to your AWS VPC, you create a hybrid network. AWS provides two primary services for this: AWS Site-to-Site VPN for a quick, encrypted connection over the internet, and AWS Direct Connect for a dedicated, private physical connection.

---

### **1. AWS Site-to-Site VPN** üåêüîí

An AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection between your on-premises network and your VPC over the **public internet**.

- **How it works:** It creates an IPsec VPN tunnel between two gateways:
  1. **Customer Gateway (CGW):** A physical device or software appliance on your side of the connection (your on-premises network). You provide AWS with information about this device.
  2. **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) / Transit Gateway:** The VPN concentrator on the AWS side. The VGW is attached to your VPC. For larger networks, you would terminate the VPN on a Transit Gateway.
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - **Connection:** Travels over the public internet.
  - **Encryption:** All traffic within the tunnel is encrypted using the IPsec protocol.
  - **Performance:** Can be variable and is limited by the quality and bandwidth of your internet connection. It is not suitable for workloads that require consistent, low latency.
  - **Setup:** Relatively quick and easy to set up (can be done in minutes or hours).
  - **Cost:** Low cost, billed on an hourly basis for the VPN connection plus standard data transfer charges.
- **Use Case:** A great solution for getting started, for connecting smaller offices, for low-to-moderate bandwidth requirements, or as a cost-effective backup for a Direct Connect link.

---

### **2. AWS Direct Connect (DX)** üîå

AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a **dedicated, private network connection** from your premises to AWS.

- **How it works:** You work with an AWS Direct Connect partner to establish a physical, private fiber-optic cable connection from your data center or office to an **AWS Direct Connect Location**. This connection completely bypasses the public internet.
- **Connection Types:**
  - **Dedicated Connection:** A physical 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or 100 Gbps Ethernet port dedicated to a single customer.
  - **Hosted Connection:** A partner provisions a connection for you with bandwidths from 50 Mbps up to 10 Gbps. This is often faster to set up and more flexible.
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - **Connection:** A private, physical connection that does not use the public internet.
  - **Performance:** Provides a consistent, low-latency, and high-bandwidth connection. It is much more reliable and predictable than a VPN.
  - **Setup:** Can take weeks or months to establish, as it involves physical cabling.
  - **Cost:** More expensive than a VPN, with charges for the port-hour and data transfer out of AWS.
- **Direct Connect Gateway:** To connect to multiple VPCs in different regions with a single Direct Connect connection, you use a **Direct Connect Gateway**. You connect your physical line to the DX Gateway, and then associate the DX Gateway with multiple Virtual Private Gateways or Transit Gateways.
