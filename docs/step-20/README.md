# Step 20: AWS WAF, AWS Shield, AWS Firewall Manager

## üéØ Objective
- [x] Master: **AWS WAF, AWS Shield, AWS Firewall Manager**

## üìò Notes

### **Deep Dive: WAF, Shield, & Firewall Manager**

As applications become more exposed to the internet, they become targets for various attacks. AWS provides a suite of managed security services that work together to create a layered defense. AWS Shield protects against DDoS attacks, AWS WAF protects against application-layer attacks, and Firewall Manager helps you manage these protections centrally.

---

### **1. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** üõ°Ô∏è

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. It operates at **Layer 7 (the Application Layer)**.

- **How it works:** You create a set of rules, called a **Web Access Control List (Web ACL)**, that define filtering logic. WAF inspects incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests and allows or blocks them based on these rules.
- **What it protects against:**
    - **SQL Injection:** Attackers embedding malicious SQL code in web requests to manipulate your database.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers injecting malicious scripts into content that is then delivered to other users' browsers.
    - It also protects against other common attacks like command injection, file inclusion, and more.
- **Types of Rules:**
    - **IP-based rules:** Block traffic from specific IP addresses or ranges.
    - **Rate-based rules:** Block IPs that send an excessive number of requests in a short period.
    - **Content-based rules:** Inspect parts of the request like the URI, query string, HTTP headers, and body for malicious patterns (e.g., block if the body contains `<script>`).
    - **AWS Managed Rule Groups:** Pre-configured sets of rules managed by AWS or AWS Marketplace sellers that protect against common threats (like the OWASP Top 10). This is the easiest way to get started.
- **Integration:** WAF is not a standalone service. It must be attached to a supported AWS resource. These include:
    - **Amazon CloudFront** distributions
    - **Application Load Balancers (ALB)**
    - **Amazon API Gateway** REST APIs
    - **AWS AppSync** GraphQL APIs

---

### **2. AWS Shield** üåä

AWS Shield is a managed **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. DDoS attacks attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.

There are two tiers of AWS Shield:

- **AWS Shield Standard:**
    - **Protection:** Defends against most common, network and transport layer (Layer 3 & 4) DDoS attacks, such as SYN floods or UDP reflection attacks.
    - **Cost:** **Free**. It is automatically enabled for all AWS customers on services like CloudFront, Route 53, and Elastic Load Balancers.
    - **Scope:** Provides baseline, always-on network flow monitoring and protection.
- **AWS Shield Advanced:**
    - **Protection:** Provides significantly more sophisticated and powerful protection for internet-facing applications on EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Route 53, and Global Accelerator. It offers enhanced detection, protection against large and sophisticated Layer 7 (application layer) DDoS attacks, and near real-time visibility into attacks.
    - **Key Features:**
        1. **24/7 DDoS Response Team (DRT):** You get access to AWS security experts who can help you during a DDoS attack.
        2. **DDoS Cost Protection:** Provides financial protection against scaling charges incurred as a result of a DDoS attack. For example, if your Auto Scaling group scales out to handle attack traffic, AWS may provide service credits for those charges.
        3. **Advanced Reporting:** Gives you detailed diagnostics and reports on attacks targeting your resources.
        4. **Bundled AWS WAF:** Using AWS WAF is included at no extra cost for your protected resources.
    - **Cost:** Paid service with a significant monthly fee plus data transfer fees. It is designed for businesses with critical, availability-sensitive applications.

---

### **3. AWS Firewall Manager** üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è

AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that allows you to centrally configure and manage firewall rules across multiple accounts and resources in your **AWS Organization**.

- **Purpose:** As you scale to dozens or hundreds of accounts, manually configuring WAF rules or security groups in each account becomes unmanageable. Firewall Manager solves this by providing a single place to deploy and monitor your security rules.
- **What it Manages:**
    - **AWS WAF rules:** Centrally deploy a common set of WAF rules to all your ALBs, API Gateways, and CloudFront distributions across the organization.
    - **AWS Shield Advanced:** Centrally enable Shield Advanced protection for all relevant resources.
    - **VPC Security Groups:** Audit and control security groups (e.g., enforce a rule that blocks inbound SSH from the internet on all instances).
    - **AWS Network Firewall:** Centrally deploy and manage stateful network firewall rules.
    - **Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall:** Centrally deploy DNS filtering rules.
- **How it Works:** You define a **policy**, select which accounts or OUs it applies to, and Firewall Manager automatically enforces that policy, ensuring that both existing and newly created resources are compliant.
